# How to get these ticket?

We are partnered with [Unifty.io](https://unifty.io/) where you will be able to use your FSAFE tokens to mine these NFT's.

I am currently developing the shop but for now we will be using their NFT platform until the shop I'm creating is finished and ready to be used :\) 

Now you will be able to say you truly have a ticket to da moon. 

Visit our current NFT Marketplace [here](https://unifty.io/bsc/farm-view.html?address=0xB87F4eFfA93Ba28E48496c7a48cC376E63b870A6).

## How to get these NFT's? 

You can either stake your FSAFE or buy the NFT's with BNB. 

## Staking

Please be warned that if you stake your FSAFE it will be transferred into a new smart contract. This means that you have to pay the 8% tax for the transfer. Each time FSAFE is transferred the tax is still applied.

EG: 10 FSAFE &gt; Stake &gt; 9.2 FSAFE &gt; Un-stake &gt; 8.464 FSAFE 

This tax applies even if you just transfer from one wallet to the other.

Also please note that you will be farming POINTS to gather these NFT's not FSAFE. 

Currently the ratio is 1 point per FSAFE  and the rate is 1 Point Per Second.
