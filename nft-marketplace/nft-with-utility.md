# NFT with utility

NFT's with functions are starting to come out into the market, for example [$MIST ](https://github.com/alchemistcoin/alchemist)they make use of [AMPL's geyser V2](https://github.com/ampleforth/token-geyser-v2), which is a liquidity mining protocol. This is only an example for utility that can come with NFTs.

There are other projects like[ $VISR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/visor-finance/) and [$MTHD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/method-finance/) that implement the same geyser v2 fork. This is one of the functions that could be coming to FSAFE tokens
