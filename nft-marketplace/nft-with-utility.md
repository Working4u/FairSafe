# NFT with utility

NFT's with functions are starting to come out into the market, for example [$MIST ](https://github.com/alchemistcoin/alchemist)they make use of [AMPL's geyser V2](https://github.com/ampleforth/token-geyser-v2), which is a liquidity mining protocol. This is only an example for utility that can come with NFTs.
