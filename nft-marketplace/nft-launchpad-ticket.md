# NFT Launchpad Ticket

## First release: 

FairSafe's first release of NFT will be on 18th of April. These NFT's will be used as tickets for future token release on FairSafe's Launch Pads. Depending on the rarity you acquire there will be different levels of allocation and amount of usage for the NFT you purchased. 



## Current issues:

This is a far more sustainable approach for the FairSafe Launchpad. As this will eliminate the current problem with today's launchpad mechanics. That being allocation amount and continuous rise in price for launchpad tokens. 

This current iteration of launchpad mechanics only provides utility for those who got in early or those who have a big enough wallet.
