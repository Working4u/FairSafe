# Education for de-fi rookies

## Education time \#1:

Method of how all recent fairs were rugged...

1. Devs release on Dxsale with botted wallets ready to buy
2. High max contribution \(Means more token allocation for single wallet\)
3. Low hardcap \(Lower hardcap the more they can maximise the RUG 2.0\)
4. Create hype for the token by not selling
5. Soon as buying pressure weakens, they smell blood
6.  Dev dumps multiple wallets on what people thought was a unruggable fair launch...
7. It was a fair launch and it is unruggable. They just didn't tell you they botted the wallets and have massive holdings in each wallet

As we head into De-Fi 2.0 scammers also develop a way to steal your hard earnt SATS. RUGGED 2.0
