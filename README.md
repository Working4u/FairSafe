## FairSafe's purpose

This isn't your typical "moonshot" project - that's only a very small part of it. The true purpose of this token is to bring light to layer 2 solutions within the BSC community. Like they say, hook, line, and sinker. 

Both the "fair" and "safe" prefixes are currently part of a big, sometimes dangerous trend within the BSC community. An unacceptably high number of people have gotten financially hurt by fake projects using such prefixes to promote themselves. This is what, above all, has inspired me to start working on this project, giving people a platform to get educated on layer 2 and its importance for de-fi at the same time.

ETH is growing rapidly and it's not going to go away anytime soon. ETH 2.0 is years away, while mainstream attraction to crypto is here now. The only available, second-best solution people can think of is BSC - but it isn't. Binance holds way too much control for it to be called a decentralised exchange. Indeed, they have the ability to shut off nodes and bridges, should that fit their agenda.

This project will first start out on BSC, for the important reason that, in the wake of the Safemoon protocol, Binance Smart Chain is currently seeing massive traffic and that, as a consequence of this, a lot of new people are exposed to scams/pump and dumps. The ultimate goal is to migrate to Polygon, where FairSafe will find its true, forever home. 

## WTFORK??? 

I won't beat around the bush like other "community" tokens: this is a fork of Safemoon, which was a fork of bee, which was a fork of blah blah blah. Nothing ground-breaking here, technology-wise. 

I have decided to start this project because after seeing so many of these supposedly "fair" tokens turn out to be absolutely unfair, resulting in people getting cheated and scammed on Dxsale. So, I thought to myself that I could make a token and actually make it to be... you know... FAIR. 

This project is currently being worked on by one developer, designer and person behind this writing altogether:  [@OxZian ](https://twitter.com/0xZian)\(twitter\) / [0xAizen ](https://github.com/0xAizen)\(github\) 

**There is also a risk of this getting outbid with gas... So please be cautious on release and do not ape in more than you can afford to lose. We are not liable for any losses and this is not a financial instrument.**

**Dxsale is not bottable due to presale contracts being unverified. But it has been said it can be scripted and outbid with gas. No confirmation of these rumours as of yet.**
