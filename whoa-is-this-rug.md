## The true origin of LIQ

Brief summary of how LIQ functions:

_**/// Liquid is an upgraded code of HeavensGate /// not only does it include an LP token burn thus locking the liquidity forever /// but also removing the ability for liquidity or ETH to be removed from the contract by the owner /// locking\(burning\) the liquidity tokens will be done manually in an exponentially growing pattern /// users can still add their own liquidity without the fear of them being lost /// the only LP that will be burnt it that which is bought by the contract**_

This is part of the FairSafe contract, which is a fork of SafeMoon contract. To learn more about how LIQ works visit this [page](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72ca0501427bb8f089c1c4f767cb17d017e803a9#code).
