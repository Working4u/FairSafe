## End of Q3 - 2021

* [ ] If community votes for contract renouncement there will be no further progress to be made with the current protocol. In this case a new smart contract must be formed. 
* [ ] New contract formation requires a new LP pool on Polygon for this to be possible another round of presale must happen. All presale participants that use a wallet that held FairSafe previously on BSC will get an airdrop of an NFT from our artists / 100% of their wallet balance that will be vested within a 3 month period. 
* [ ] FairSafe launch with brand new contract that will feature the [EIP-2535 Diamonds](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/diamond-standard)
