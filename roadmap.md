# Roadmap

So we're already in Q2 We will start from there.

## Start of Q2 - 2021

* [x] Launch [smart contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xee738a9e5fb78c24d26cecd30389ed977c38d0ca) into the main net.
* [x] Launch website for Fair Safe.
* [x] Launch pre-sale on dxsale
* [ ] Audit: NightWatch Operations - 0.5 ETH / Solid\_1 - $1800
* [ ] Marketing to spread awareness of the project. \(YouTube/TikTok/Twitter\)
* [ ] NFT Market Place. \(Dapp will be worked on once presale is over\)

## End of Q3 - 2021

* [ ] If community votes for contract renouncement there will be no further progress to be made with the current protocol. In this case a new smart contract must be formed. 
* [ ] New contract formation requires a new LP pool on Polygon for this to be possible another round of presale must happen. All presale participants that use a wallet that held FairSafe previously on BSC will get an airdrop of an NFT from our artists / 100% of their wallet balance that will be vested within a 3 month period. 
* [ ] FairSafe launch with brand new contract that will feature the [EIP-2535 Diamonds](https://docs.aavegotchi.com/overview/diamond-standard)

I will update the road map as the project progresses so please if you are part of the community and support this project to your best to keep up with us!
