## Dxsale details

Softcap: 25 

Hardcap: 125 

Liquidity Unlocks: 7 APR **2025** at 13:00 \(4 Years\)

Hard cap is high so tokens can circulate to more holders, lower hardcap = higher chances of getting dumped on. This is the idea anyway, but there will likely be bots on the dxsale presale page. So please proceed with caution
