# Token use case

At the current development cycle there is no use case for the token, just like many tokens. But as the project progresses the plan is for the token to be used for governance to vote for community activities and the future of the protocol. 

* Governance implementation
* NFT Ticket Farming
* NFT Market Place: Market place for artist that is fair and safe + future NFT released by FairSafe. 
* NFT Clothing - Creating merch that will be available for purchase, users can chose to mint NFT or get it delivered to them. If user mints clothing into NFT it will be sent to their address via ERC721 token and physical merch will be burnt video of clothing burn will be uploaded as a ERC721 token for proof.
