# Tokenomics

There will be 1,000,000,000,000,000 FSAFE Token in existence.

FairSafe has 3 simple functions: Reflection + Liquidity Pool acquisition + Burn with each trade, and the transaction is taxed with a rate of 8%. This is split into 2 sections:

* 3% fee that is redistributed to all existing holders. This includes the burn wallet.
* 5% fee that is split into 2. One half being sold by the contract and the other half of the FSAFE tokens are automatically paired with the BNB. This creates a Liquidity Pool token that is then added to Pancakeswap. 



To maximize the fairness for each investor there will only be a maximum allocation of 2 BNB per TX. 

The presale and listing price will be the same: 2,000,000,000,000 FSAFE = 1 BNB.
